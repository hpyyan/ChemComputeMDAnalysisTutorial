    "7) There is a great MDAnalysis demonstration on YouTube that I recommend you check out here:\\\n",
    "https://youtu.be/zVQGFysYDew \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "In particular, there is a demonstration where they plot RMSF (root mean squared fluctuations) of the alpha carbons of a protein changing as a function of time. The RMSF plot basically shows you which alpha carbons are the most \"wiggly\" as you move down the protein's backbone. The code written in the YouTube video uses a trick whereby averaging is done while iterating over the loop by reweighting based on how far along in the loop you are (e.g. note that they use enumerate to get the iterator k, and then reweight so that the 2nd step is weight 1/2, then 3rd is 2/3, then 3/4, etc.). If you'd like to code it their way, simply copy their code in a cell below, just make sure you read it carefully and are able to explain to someone else how it works! The method they use is great for efficiency, and is often used when massive data sets cannot be loaded in their entirety, so one must calculate averages while loading the data piece by piece. In our case, we are working with a very small data set by molecular dynamics standards, so we can easily load the full data set and carry out averaging the standard way (do the full sum, then divide). In a cell below, write a code that uses the MDAnalysis library to create a plot of RMSF as a function of residue number, like the one in their video, from your trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to try writing your own code for calculating RMSF, here are some steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store all the alpha carbon positions in an array called ca_positions by looping over the trajectory object accessible from the Universe object (u.trajectory).\n",
    "- Store the mean positions of these alpha carbons in array mean_positions by using the mean method native to arrays.\n",
    "- Calculate the squared displacements by subtracting the mean positions from the ca positions and squaring that difference. __Note:__ since ca_positions and mean_positions are numpy arrays, you can do the subtraction and squaring as vector operations, so no need to write a loop of any sort.\n",
    "- Calculate the mean squared displacement by taking the mean of the squared_displacements array. __Note:__ the final squared displacements involve summing over the squared displacements in x,y, and z. If that seems odd, consider that the definition of Euclidean distance is: $$r = \\sqrt{\\Delta x^2 + \\Delta y^2 + \\Delta z^2},$$ so it is really not so strange since $$r^2 = \\Delta x^2 + \\Delta y^2 + \\Delta z^2$$.\n",
    "- The only part of the calculation at this point is to take the square root, since it is a __root__ mean squared fluctuation, afterall! Thus the last step is, rmsf = np.sqrt(mean_squared_displacements).\n",
    "- As far as plotting goes, use matplotlib.pyplot to plot RMSF the same way Dr. Beckstein does it in his video."
